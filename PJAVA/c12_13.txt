A resource is declared and created followed by the keyword try. Note that the resources are
enclosed in the parentheses (lines 9–12). The resources must be a subtype of AutoCloseable
such as a PrinterWriter that has the close() method. A resource must be declared and
created in the same statement and multiple resources can be declared and created inside the
parentheses. The statements in the block (lines 12–18) immediately following the resource
declaration use the resource. After the block is finished, the resource’s close() method
is automatically invoked to close the resource. Using try-with-resources can not only avoid
errors but also make the code simpler.
